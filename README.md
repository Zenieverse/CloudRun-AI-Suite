# CloudRun-AI-Suite
CloudRun AI Suite is an intelligent, modular platform that transforms natural-language ideas into fully deployable, scalable serverless applications on Google Cloud Run — powered by AI Studio (Gemini) and Google’s serverless ecosystem. It acts as a “prompt-to-production” accelerator, combining generative AI, automated CI/CD, and cloud orchestration to help developers, AI enthusiasts, and hackathon teams go from concept → code → Cloud Run deployment in minutes.

🚀 Overview
CloudRun AI Suite demonstrates how serverless infrastructure and AI-assisted development can converge to simplify the entire application lifecycle:
Prompt — Describe your idea in natural language (e.g., “Build an API that generates summaries of PDFs”).
Generate — AI Studio (Gemini) automatically writes your backend logic, APIs, Dockerfile, and deployment scripts.
Deploy — The suite packages and deploys your app to Cloud Run with one command or through CI/CD automation.
Scale — Cloud Run handles scaling, concurrency, and GPU workloads seamlessly.
🧩 Core Modules
🧠 Prompt-to-API Generator
Converts plain English API descriptions into deployable Flask/FastAPI microservices with OpenAPI docs, Dockerfiles, and health checks — instantly deployable to Cloud Run.
📄 AI Resume Analyzer
Analyzes uploaded resumes (PDF/TXT), extracts structured data, summarizes candidate strengths, and scores profiles using Gemini — all within a secure, ephemeral Cloud Run service.
🎓 EduBot
Generates learning modules and quizzes from any topic prompt using Gemini. Provides deterministic (seed-based) content generation and stores usage metrics via Firestore.
⚙️ Architecture
Frontend/UI: Modern, responsive App Canvas interface built with React or HTML/CSS/JS.
Backend Services: Each demo runs as an independent Cloud Run service (HTTP/Job/Worker).
AI Integration: Uses Gemini APIs for code generation, NLP, and content creation.
Data Layer: Firestore + Cloud Storage for logging, Pub/Sub for agent communication.
GPU Acceleration: Supports NVIDIA L4 GPU instances for model inference workloads.
Automation: Includes GitHub Actions for regen/build/deploy and Terraform for setup.

💡 Vision
To showcase a future where AI + serverless = instant innovation, empowering anyone — from students to startups — to build, test, and deploy powerful cloud applications without managing infrastructure or writing every line of code.
