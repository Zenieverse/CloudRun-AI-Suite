# CloudRun-AI-Suite
CloudRun AI Suite is an intelligent, modular platform that transforms natural-language ideas into fully deployable, scalable serverless applications on Google Cloud Run — powered by AI Studio (Gemini) and Google’s serverless ecosystem. It acts as a “prompt-to-production” accelerator, combining generative AI, automated CI/CD, and cloud orchestration to help developers, AI enthusiasts, and hackathon teams go from concept → code → Cloud Run deployment in minutes.

Project Summary — CloudRun AI Suite
CloudRun AI Suite is an end-to-end framework that transforms natural language ideas into live, scalable applications on Google Cloud Run. It showcases three flagship modules — Prompt-to-API, AI Resume Analyzer, and EduBot — each generated and deployed using AI Studio (Gemini) and orchestrated via Pub/Sub and Firestore.
The system automates the full prompt-to-production pipeline: AI Studio converts prompts into backend code (Flask, FastAPI, Dockerfiles), Cloud Build handles containerization, and Cloud Run deploys frontends, backends, and GPU services with auto-scaling. It integrates Gemini 1.5 Pro for code and text generation, Gemma 2 for summarization, and Vertex AI Embeddings for analysis.
Key features include:
🧩 Prompt-to-API Generator: Converts plain English into deployable REST APIs.
🧠 AI Resume Analyzer: Extracts, summarizes, and scores resumes securely.
📚 EduBot: Creates bite-sized learning modules and quizzes dynamically.
⚙️ CI/CD Automation: GitHub Actions + Terraform enable one-click redeploys.
☁️ Cloud-Native Orchestration: Multi-service Cloud Run architecture with Pub/Sub and Firestore coordination.
Built entirely with Google Cloud technologies, CloudRun AI Suite demonstrates how to go from idea → code → deployment in minutes — powered by AI and serverless innovation.

🚀 Overview
CloudRun AI Suite demonstrates how serverless infrastructure and AI-assisted development can converge to simplify the entire application lifecycle:
Prompt — Describe your idea in natural language (e.g., “Build an API that generates summaries of PDFs”).
Generate — AI Studio (Gemini) automatically writes your backend logic, APIs, Dockerfile, and deployment scripts.
Deploy — The suite packages and deploys your app to Cloud Run with one command or through CI/CD automation.
Scale — Cloud Run handles scaling, concurrency, and GPU workloads seamlessly.
🧩 Core Modules
🧠 Prompt-to-API Generator
Converts plain English API descriptions into deployable Flask/FastAPI microservices with OpenAPI docs, Dockerfiles, and health checks — instantly deployable to Cloud Run.
📄 AI Resume Analyzer
Analyzes uploaded resumes (PDF/TXT), extracts structured data, summarizes candidate strengths, and scores profiles using Gemini — all within a secure, ephemeral Cloud Run service.
🎓 EduBot
Generates learning modules and quizzes from any topic prompt using Gemini. Provides deterministic (seed-based) content generation and stores usage metrics via Firestore.
⚙️ Architecture
Frontend/UI: Modern, responsive App Canvas interface built with React or HTML/CSS/JS.
Backend Services: Each demo runs as an independent Cloud Run service (HTTP/Job/Worker).
AI Integration: Uses Gemini APIs for code generation, NLP, and content creation.
Data Layer: Firestore + Cloud Storage for logging, Pub/Sub for agent communication.
GPU Acceleration: Supports NVIDIA L4 GPU instances for model inference workloads.
Automation: Includes GitHub Actions for regen/build/deploy and Terraform for setup.
🌐 Key Features

💡 Vision
To showcase a future where AI + serverless = instant innovation, empowering anyone — from students to startups — to build, test, and deploy powerful cloud applications without managing infrastructure or writing every line of code.
